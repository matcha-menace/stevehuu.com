<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>
  All of the audio in HyperStars are created by me in collaboration with Donovan
  Robinson, Sherry Jin, and Regina Xia. The goal for HyperStar's audio was to be
  as interactive as possible to best accompany the fast paced action in
  gameplay.

<h4>Wwise</h4>
<p>
  I used Wwise for 2 major elements for HyperStars: sound effects, and
  interactive music. Since the game has a heavy emphasis on “performance”, the
  music and crowd reacts to how each player is doing. It builds up as more
  action is happening and swells into climax if a player makes a comeback.

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>
  I've written, composed, and produced 1 out of the 8 planned character's theme
  songs during our production timeline during NYU. You can listen to it on
  Spotify and Soundcloud. The song features Sherry Jin for vocals.
